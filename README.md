# Trueque
`One mans trash is another mans treasure`

## Description
- Trueque was designed and developed with Earth in mind: 
    - We are all well aware of the climate crisis we are currently living and how industries like fashion are main actors in this crisis.
    - We are also human, and as humans we find joy in new things, in wanting things and getting them.

- Trueque allows consumers an opportunity to halt their contribution to pollution by exchanging items they might throw away for items they might want.
