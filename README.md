# <The_Sequelizers>

## Description
    
    Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
    
    - What was your motivation?

    - We designed this webpage application to demonstrate our skills and display a real world application that allows users to look for and trade items in a simplistic, efficient way.

    - This ultimately solves the problem of having random items that you would like to exchange, and give value to said items by making them available for trade with provided feedback and comments from users. 

    - What did you learn?
    
## Table of Contents (Optional)
    
    If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
    
    - [Installation](#installation)
    - [Usage](#usage)
    - [Credits](#credits)
    - [License](#license)
    
## Installation
    
    ***(What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running)

    First we created a project on GitHub, and each member git cloned the project repository into our local computers. Inside VS Code, we created all the files and folders using terminal commands, allowing us to separate the content within the directory. The json packages were created automatically after packages we needed for the project were installed using npm install commands in the terminal. 
    
## Usage
    
    Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
    
## Screenshot 

    To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    
        ```md
        ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
        ```

## License
    
    The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
    
    ---
    
    üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
    
## Badges
    
    ![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)
    
    Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
    
## Features
    
    If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
    
## How to Contribute
    
    If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
    
## Tests
    
    Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
